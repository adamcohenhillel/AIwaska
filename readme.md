# AIwaska, Concept Game
In the future, entertainment will be all about personalization. AIwaska is a concept game that showcases this capability by using a Generative-AI engine to create an immersive, 360, interactive world based on a user prompt. This technology can be used by game developers to reduce production costs, or by users who want to explore custom worlds tailored to their desires.
